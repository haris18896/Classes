# SingleTon

sometimes we need to make sure that we have one and only one instance on an object.

SingleTon is a design pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class is created and it is accessible from anywhere in the program.

in the `Finished` folder you will find the implementation of the SingleTon pattern. also in the `start` folder the logger has been changed so that it can only export one and only one instance of the logger which makes it easier to use.
